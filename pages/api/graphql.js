export default apolloServer.createHandler({ path: "/api/graphql" }); // we use apolloServer to create a new handler, which means the path /api/graphql will serve as an entry point for our GraphQL server.

// Unlike regular Apollo Server, Next.js handles the start of the server for us since it relies on server-side rendering. That is why, here, we donâ€™t have to start the GraphQL server on our own.
